# This config file is for settings that are about the players themselves, and the player disguises!

# Shall the players view their disguises?
# Best used when viewing yourself in 3rd person
ViewSelfDisguises: true

# Are self disguises enabled by default
# Default is true
ViewSelfDisguisesDefault: true

# Shall the disguised hear their disguise sounds or their damage sounds.
# I disable this as it can be a little confusing when not used with self disguises
HearSelfDisguise: true

# Some disguises are rather big and tall and block your vision
# By default those disguises are enabled despite misgivings, such as zombies, players, etc.
# The baby versions however, should be short enough that it's a non-issue
TallSelfDisguises: true

# How should the plugin handle self disguises scoreboards? It disables pushing in whichever team they're assigned.
# If you want them to be able to push again when they undisguise, set this to CREATE_SCOREBOARD
# I have to disable pushing or you will be pushed around by your own self disguise
# MODIFY_SCOREBOARD - Modifies the player's current team if possible, otherwise assigns them to a new scoreboard team.
# IGNORE_SCOREBOARD - Doesn't touch scoreboards at all, effectively means that if you didn't disable pushing in their scoreboard team; They will still be pushed around
# CREATE_SCOREBOARD - Creates a new team which copies the attributes of their previous scoreboard team which they are then assigned to. This means they keep nametag color and other options.
SelfDisguisesScoreboard: 'MODIFY_SCOREBOARD'

# Default is 5 seconds
